# üîí Access Log List Project (C++ Console)

A **C++ console application** designed to securely manage and analyze user login records, tracking login frequency, and providing administrative reporting.

---

## üéØ Overview

The **Access Log List Project** is a robust console-based system built in C++ to handle user access. It automatically records login events, maintains a permanent list of users, increments login counts, and time-stamps each event. This ensures data integrity through **file persistence** in `dataset.txt`, making it a reliable tool for simple user statistics and access auditing.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Data Persistence:** All user records are automatically **saved to and loaded from `dataset.txt`**, ensuring no data is lost between sessions.
* **Case-Insensitive Login:** Usernames are handled case-insensitively (e.g., "Akash" and "AKASH" are the same user), preventing duplicate records.
* **Automatic Time Stamping:** Every login is recorded with the **current date and time** using C++ `<chrono>` and `<ctime>`.
* **Admin Dashboard:** A secure, password-protected menu offering advanced views and analytics.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Easily identify the **most frequent user(s)** and view the last user who logged in.
* **Efficient Storage:** Utilizes the C++ Standard Template Library **`std::list`** for efficient in-memory record management.
